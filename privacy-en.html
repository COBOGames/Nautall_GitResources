<h3><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p><em>Last update: October 19, 2020</em></p>

<p>
    At Nautall we recognize that privacy is important. This policy has been created to explain our
    privacy practices at Nautall, so that you understand what information about you is collected and
    how it is used.
</p>

<p>
    By using our application, you agree to the terms and practices described in this policy. We
    reserve the right to change, modify or alter this policy at any time. You will be notified of
    any changes, but it is recommended to consult this Policy regularly in case you do not receive
    the notification.
</p>

<p><strong>1. WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p><u>Personal information</u></p>
<p>
    <em>Login.</em> In order to login in to Nautall, a username and password of the @nauta email that
    <a href='http://www.etecsa.cu'>ETECSA</a> offers to mobile phone users in Cuba is required.
</p>
<p><u>Non-Personal Information</u></p>
<p>
    <em>Device information.</em> When you send a feedback, next to your feedback is added the
    Android Version, Brand, Manufacturer and Model of your device.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Log data.</em>  Logging is optional. It can be enabled in Settings &gt; Debugging.
</p>

<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><u>Personal information</u></p>
<p>
    <em>Login.</em> The username and password used at the start of the session are encrypted and
    stored on your device in the internal data folder of the application. These are used solely
    and exclusively to authenticate with the server when sending or receiving emails
    (they are never sent to external servers).
</p>
<p><u>Non-Personal Information</u></p>
<p>
    <em>Device information.</em> The information of your device attached to a feedback is 
	used to fix any bug that you report to the developers.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Log data.</em> The logging, apart from being optional, is only stored on your device in the
    external data folder of the application. You can use it to copy an error thrown by the
    application and send it to the developers.
</p>

<p><strong>3. APPLICATION PERMISSIONS</strong></p>
<p>
    This section describes what permissions with dangerous protection level are used in Nautall.
</p>
<p>
    <em>CALL_PHONE.</em> Used when you send a donation of your device balance to the developers.
</p>
<p>
    <em>CAMERA.</em> Used for barcode and QR code capture.
</p>
<p>
    <em>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.</em>
    Used only for compatibility on devices with versions of Android 4.0 since the application does
    not read or write outside its internal or external data folders.
